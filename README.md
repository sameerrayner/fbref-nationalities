# Top Nationalities in the Premier League in the last 10 seasons
Source data: <a href = 'https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/2022-2023/nations/2022-2023-Premier-League-Nationalities'>FBRef</a>

For this project, I wrote a Python script to webscrape and clean/format data from FBRef about nations with players who played in the Premier League in the last 10 seasons. I then created an interactive Power BI report containing a custom global shape map showing these nations, a ribbon chart based on RANKX DAX showing the Top 5 most common nations per season and a hidden drill-through page containing a column chart for the nation selected.

This repository contains my Python script and my DAX code. For the results, see <a href = "https://www.sameerrayner.com/portfolio/pokemon-type-chart"> my portfolio</a>.
